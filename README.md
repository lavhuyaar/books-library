# The Odin Project 8 - Library

I finished it!!!!!!!!!

Was really scared with this project coz I was coding after a while(exams you see). Very very happy that I finished this project on my own using my own brain, this project was really fun to build.

But I think I could've made it in a better way, the code is too long ig. Could've reduced the length with appropriate use of prototype. 

Still so much to learn. Very excited for future :D
